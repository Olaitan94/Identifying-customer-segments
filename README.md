# Identifying-customer-segments

In this project, unsupervised learning techniques (PCA & clustering) are used to identify segments for a mail-order sales company in Germany. The data is provided by Udacity's partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics.

The data was first cleaned. The cleaning process involved handling missing values, feature selection and feature engineering.

Then PCA was applied to reduce the dimensions of the dataset and a scree plot was sued to select the no of useful dimensions.

Finally, the data was segnented into clusters using the kmean algorithm.
