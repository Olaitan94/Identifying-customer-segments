# Identifying-customer-segments

In this project, unsupervised learning techniques are used to identify core customer segments for a mail-order sales company in Germany. The data, provided by Udacity's partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, represents a real-life data science task.

Step 1 involves preprocessing the data, including handling missing values, deciding on feature removal, and addressing data points that require special treatment.

Step 2 focuses on feature transformation, where dimensionality reduction techniques like feature scaling and PCA are applied to identify relationships between variables and reduce dimensionality.

Step 3 involves clustering the transformed data to identify groups in the general demographic data and compare them with the customer dataset to understand market segment differences. The k-means method is used for clustering, and the results are analyzed to determine likely consumer types for the mail-order sales company
